              <p>Competitive programming can be a mind game held over internet or any local network. As per the
                  specific instructions, contestants have to code the program. Competitive programming is worldwide
                  recognized and supported by Google, Facebook, ACM ICPC, TCS and many more.<br>
                  A competitive contest usually involves the contestant to solve a set of logical or mathematical problems
                  and the contestants are required to write computer programs.<br>
                  Assessment is based on the number of problems solved, time spent for writing, quality of output,
                  execution time, space occupied by the program, etc.<br>
                  
                  The challenges in the competitive programming in CodeNow help you to be the best in problem solving
                  with the best logic. Every 15 days hackathon coding contest highlights your capability in competing with
                  your problem solving skills.</p>

<p>In most of the above competitions, since the number of contestants is quite large, competitions are usually organized in several rounds. They usually require online participation in all rounds except the last, which require onsite participation. A special exception to this is IEEEXtreme, which is a yearly 24-hour virtual programming competition. The top performers at IOI and ACM-ICPC receive gold, silver and bronze medals while in the other contests, cash prizes are awarded to the top finishers. Also hitting the top places in the score tables of such competitions may attract interest of recruiters from software and Internet companies.</p>
