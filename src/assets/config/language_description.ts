It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[6] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource- constrained applications, [6] including desktop applications, servers(e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance- critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[7] C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms.Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.",
